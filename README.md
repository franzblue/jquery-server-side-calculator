Tasked with creating a calculator using jquery. All computational logic was performed on the server. AJAX, Express, body-parser, modules and nodes, all of these where used in tandem to achieve the end result.

Simply run program on a server. The default port is set to: 5000.

Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
